Got it! I reviewed our entire conversation for Jenkins-related code topics you asked about or I provided. Here's a curated list with my recommendations on which to **learn now**, **learn later**, or **ignore/optional** based on your level and typical DevOps needs.

| **String handling in Jenkinsfile**     | Manipulating strings in Groovy             | 🟡 Learn Later | Useful but not urgent                              |
| **List, arrays, maps in Jenkins**      | Collections handling                       | 🟡 Learn Later | Useful when pipelines get complex                  |
| **Conditionals (`if`, `when`)**        | Stage and step-level conditional execution | ✅ Must Learn   | Critical for control flow                          |
| **Loops in Jenkinsfile**               | For loops, iterating over collections      | 🟡 Learn Later | Needed for more complex automation                 |
| **Functions in Jenkinsfile (Groovy)**  | Writing reusable logic                     | 🟡 Learn Later | Advanced for shared libraries                      |
| **Shell steps (`sh`) in Jenkins**      | Executing shell commands                   | ✅ Must Learn   | Core to most Jenkins pipelines                     |
| **Credentials usage with Groovy**      | `withCredentials` and safe secret handling | ✅ Must Learn   | Security best practice                             |

| **When condition in Declarative**      | Conditional execution of stages            | ✅ Must Learn   | Used everywhere for environment or branch logic    |
| **Boolean logic in Jenkinsfile**       | Using boolean parameters, expressions      | ✅ Must Learn   | Fundamental for toggles and flags                  |
| **Null safety in Jenkinsfile**         | Safe handling of null values               | 🟡 Learn Later | Good for production-ready pipelines but not urgent |
| **Jenkinsfile debugging & logging**    | Using `echo` for visibility                | ✅ Must Learn   | Essential skill for troubleshooting                |
| **Pipeline version locking (modules)** | Using module versions (terraform example)  | ❌ Ignore       | Not Jenkins-specific, Terraform context only       |
| **Shared libraries in Jenkins**        | Reusable pipeline code                     | 🟡 Learn Later | Advanced, learn once basics are solid              |
| **Pipeline parallelism**               | Running steps/stages in parallel           | 🟡 Learn Later | Useful for performance, not immediate priority     |
| **Retry blocks**                       | Retry failed steps                         | 🟡 Learn Later | Important but comes after error handling           |
| **CatchError vs try-catch**            | Different error handling styles            | 🟡 Learn Later | Advanced error handling                            |
| **Multi-branch pipeline config**       | Branch-specific Jenkinsfile behavior       | ✅ Must Learn   | Common real-world use                              |
| **Pipeline parameters and input**      | User inputs & parameters in pipeline       | ✅ Must Learn   | Core for flexible pipelines                        |
